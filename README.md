Ground truth of Berlin, Chicago, Paris, Potsdam, and Zurich consist of aerial images from Google Maps 
and pixel-wise building, road, and background labels from OpenStreetMap. Ground truth of Tokyo consists 
of one aerial image from Google Maps and manually generated, pixel-wise building, road, and background labels. 

Pixel-wise labels are provided as PNG images in RGB order. Pixels labeled as building, road, and
background are indicated by RGB colors [255,0,0], [0,0,255], and [255,255,255].

Ground truth was generated in
    Berlin   Spring 2016

    Potsdam  Spring 2016
    Tokyo    Spring 2017

Ground truth of Potsdam covers the same area as the publicly avaialble, manually labeled ISPRS ground 
truth
